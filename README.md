# Talking To Chat GPT

This repo contains notes on select conversations with Chat GPT that I want
to archive for my future reference.

I stress the following points:
* This is not a scientific investigation of mechanics of Chat GPT nor have I
any ambitions in this respect
* The character of these notes is therefore rather informal - they are focused
on subjective observations
* I do not complain about the Chat GPT - it is an excellent platform.
Any critical opinions expressed here about the Chat should be construed as a
constructive criticism rather than pointless ranting characteristic of know-it-all youtuber-morons who to making up for shortcomings of their cognitive faculties (which they evince by not being able to stick to the train of thoughts of complex sentences) by using populist shitty camera shots
